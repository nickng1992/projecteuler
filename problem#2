#Project Euler Problem #2 (https://projecteuler.net/problem=1)
#Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

#1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

#By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
#This program displays the Fibonacci sequence up to n-th term and find the sum of the even number terms

nterms = int(input("How many terms? "))

# 1.INPUT
# first two terms
n1, n2 = 0, 1
count = 0
sum=0
print("Fibonacci sequence:")

# 2.PROCESS
while count < nterms:
  print(n1)
  
  if n1%2==0:
    sum=sum+n1

  nth = n1 + n2
  # update values
  n1 = n2
  n2 = nth
  count += 1

# 3.OUTPUT
print ("sum of even number = " + str(sum))
